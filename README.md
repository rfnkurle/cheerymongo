The Onion News Scraper
1. One home page, click "Scrape this Baby."
2. Page should populate with articles scraped from "www.theonion.com," giving a clickable title-link to the actual Onion article, and a brief summary of the article. 
3. Click "Leave a Comment" to produce comment modal. Click "Save."

*  Even though the "Save" note function doesn't actually work, it does send and "id" of the note to the Mongo database, which I guess is a win?


Todos:
Need to look closely and correctly re-wire the routes to be able to:
-save articles to a different page.
- to populate saved notes that are written in modal by id.
- and then be able to delete those saved notes.
